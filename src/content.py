## 📝 About
### BiGGen-Bench Leaderboard

Welcome to the 🌟 BiGGen-Bench Leaderboard 🚀, a dedicated benchmarking platform designed to evaluate the nuanced capabilities of Generative Language Models (GLMs) across a variety of complex and diverse tasks. Leveraging the refined methodologies of [BiGGen-Bench](https://github.com/prometheus-eval/prometheus-eval), our leaderboard offers a comprehensive assessment framework that mirrors human-like discernment and precision in evaluating language models.

#### Evaluation Details

- **Evaluation Scope**: Covers nine key capabilities of GLMs across 77 tasks, with 765 unique instances tailored to test specific aspects of model performance.
- **Scoring System**: Utilizes a detailed scoring rubric from 1 to 5, reflecting a range of outcomes based on instance-specific criteria closely aligned with the nuanced requirements of each task.
- **Hardware and Setup**: Benchmarks are conducted using a controlled setup to ensure consistent and fair comparison across different models.
- **Transparency and Openness**: All codes, data, and detailed evaluation results are publicly available to foster transparency and enable community-driven enhancements and verifications.

#### Benchmarking Script

All benchmarks are executed using the provided [code](https://github.com/prometheus-eval/prometheus-eval/blob/main/BiGGen-Bench) within the BiGGen-Bench repository. This script ensures that all models are evaluated under identical conditions, guaranteeing reliability and reproducibility of results.
